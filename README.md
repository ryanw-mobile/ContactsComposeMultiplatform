# MVI Compose Multiplatform Contacts List App With Photos (iOS & Android) - KMM Tutorial

This repository is a replicate following the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWSzbMnpAgI&t=3389s) given by Philipp Lackner.

One major difference is that I was forced to upgrade the dependency versions as the SQLDelight in this project was too old to function on my Android Studio. The ripple effect made some syntax changes related to the database handling.
